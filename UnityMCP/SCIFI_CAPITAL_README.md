## 🛠️ Customization

### Change Building Heights
```powershell
# In create-scifi-capital.ps1, find:
Build-Skyscraper -name "CyanTower01" -height 150

# Change to:
Build-Skyscraper -name "CyanTower01" -height 200  # Taller!
```

### Modify District Colors
```powershell
# Find color variables:
$cyanColor = @{ r = 0.0; g = 0.8; b = 1.0 }

# Change to:
$cyanColor = @{ r = 0.0; g = 1.0; b = 0.5 }  # Cyan-green
```

### Add More Skyways
```powershell
Build-Skyway -name "CustomSkyway" `
    -x1 X_START -y HEIGHT -z1 Z_START `
    -x2 X_END -z2 Z_END `
    -width 6
```

### Add More Vehicles

## ⚡ Performance Tips

### Occlusion Culling
Organize into 5 zones:
- Cyan District (-100 to -40, 40 to 100)
- Magenta District (40 to 100, 40 to 100)
- Yellow District (40 to 100, -100 to -40)
- Orange District (-100 to -40, -100 to -40)
- Central Plaza (-40 to 40, -40 to 40)

**Benefit:** Cull entire districts when not visible (~200 objects per district)

### LOD Recommendations
- **LOD 0:** 0-60 units (full detail)
- **LOD 1:** 60-150 units (50% reduction)
- **LOD 2:** 150-300 units (80% reduction)
- **LOD 3:** 300+ units (billboards, 95% reduction)

### Material Batching
Buildings share similar materials:
- Building bodies: Dark steel blue, metallic 0.8-0.9
- Glowing edges: District colors with emission
- Roads: Dark asphalt, metallic 0.3
- Vehicles: Car paint, metallic 0.8-0.9

**Result:** Good batching opportunities for performance!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Q: Script runs but no objects appear
**A:** Ensure Unity MCP server is running. Check Unity console for errors.

### Q: Buildings look too dark
**A:** Enable bloom post-processing to enhance emission glows.

### Q: Frame rate drops
**A:** Enable occlusion culling and implement LOD system (see Performance Tips).

### Q: Can't find specific building
**A:** Use color-coding: Cyan (NW), Magenta (NE), Yellow (SE), Orange (SW).

### Q: Skyways too low/high for gameplay
**A:** Edit skyway heights in script (search for "Build-Skyway").
