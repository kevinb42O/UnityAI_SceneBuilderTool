## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Asset Store Rejection
**Mitigation:** Submit 2 weeks before launch, use approval time for marketing prep. If rejected, launch GitHub-only and resubmit with fixes.

### Risk: Low Initial Traction
**Mitigation:** Aggressive outreach to Unity YouTubers. If <50 downloads Day 1, pivot to influencer-first strategy.

### Risk: Negative Reviews
**Mitigation:** Beta test with 20 users first. Fix all critical bugs before launch. Respond to negative reviews within 2 hours.

### Risk: Competitor Launches
**Mitigation:** Monitor GitHub, Asset Store, Product Hunt daily. If competitor appears, emphasize our performance (390x faster) and MCP integration (industry standard).

### Risk: Technical Issues
**Mitigation:** Set up error logging (Sentry), monitor Discord support channel 24/7 during launch week. Have rollback plan if critical bug found.
