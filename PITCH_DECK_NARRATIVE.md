# Unity AI Scene Builder: Pitch Deck Narrative

**The 10-Slide Story That Changes Game Development Forever**

---

## Slide 1: The Hook

### "What if anyone could build a game?"

**Visual:** Split screen
- Left: Traditional game developer (stressed, surrounded by code, 3D software)
- Right: Regular person speaking naturally ("Create a fantasy world")

**Narration:**
> "Game development has always been locked behind technical barriers. Programming. 3D modeling. Complex software. But what if that changed? What if building a game was as simple as describing your vision?"

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### "Game Development Is Broken"

**Visual:** Three barriers as walls

**Barrier 1: Technical Skills**
- Required: Unity, C#, Blender, Photoshop
- Learning time: 2-3 years
- Result: 90% of aspiring developers quit

**Barrier 2: Team Size**
- AAA games: 100-500 person teams
- Indies: 3-6 specialists needed
- Solo devs: Can't compete

**Barrier 3: Time & Cost**
- Single level: 40-100 hours
- Complete game: 2-5 years
- Budget: $100,000+ for quality

**Narration:**
> "To make a game today, you need years of training, a team of specialists, and massive time investment. This locks out 99% of creative people who have game ideas but lack technical skills."

---

## Slide 3: The Market

### "2.8 Million Developers Need This"

**Visual:** Growing chart + persona icons

**Market Size:**
- Unity developers worldwide: 2.8 million
- Growing at: 25% per year
- 3D game developers: 1.68 million (60%)
- Need world generation: 1.34 million (80%)

**Market Segments:**
1. **Solo Indies** (60%): Want to build alone, need force-multiplier
2. **Small Studios** (30%): 2-10 people, need faster iteration
3. **Educators** (10%): Teaching game design, need accessible tools

**Narration:**
> "Unity powers 50% of all games. Nearly 3 million developers use it. And they're all facing the same bottleneck: creating worlds takes too long and requires too many specialized skills."
